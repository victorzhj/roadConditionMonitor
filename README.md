This main branch includes a design document.

This is a QT-project so to use the application, Qt-library and Qt-creator are required. In Qt-creator all user needs to do is to open the pro file in rojekti folder and run the project.
After that the application should open and in the application you can draw the gragh by pressing the button named graph.
As of now the only functionality is to draw a graph where the values are hard coded to show an example on how the application will work but later on user can select what they want to be drawn on the graph.
